## :octocat: About me

### Hi there!

I am Emanuel, a young Software Engineer constantly on the lookout for mentally challenging coding opportunities.

Most of my past programming experience is with **JavaScript** but through the past few years I've been trying out other programming languages such as **C++**, **Python**, **Kotlin**, **Rust**, **Go**, **Haskell**, **OCaml**, **Scala**, and **Elm**.
