## :octocat: About me

### Hi there!

I am Emanuel, a full stack typescript engineer, constantly on the lookout for mentally challenging coding opportunities.

Most of my programming experience consists of building full-stack **Next.js** / **Node.js** apps in **TypeScript**. Through the past few years I've been trying out other programming languages as well, such as **C++**, **Python**, **Rust**, **Go**, **Haskell**, **OCaml**, **Scala**, **Kotlin**, **Java**, and **Elm**.
